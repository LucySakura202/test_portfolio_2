### About Me 
Hello! I am an experienced Principal Investigator and psychology professional with over 2 years of proven expertise in Psychology and Clinical Psychology. 

With skills in Data Collection, Clinical Research, Data Consolidation, and Leadership, I am able to organize research data, and achieve understandable research reports. I am adept at using Excel, Python, and Microsoft Access. 

My broad skill set, commitment to accuracy, and passion for helping people makes me a valuable asset.  In my spare time, I like to draw and listen to music. 

### Education

### Projects

#### Personality Quiz
 - I decided to make each personality type a variable and add one point to it each time its corresponding answer was chosen, then display the personality type with the most points.

 - Project 1 Report

#### Grading Calculator (J Doodle) 
 - This helps me determine what grade I need on an assignment to get a certain class grade, when I only know the scores I got on previous assignments. I also can predict my grade.

#### Grading Calculator (Apporto) 
 - Instead of just giving you one class grade, it averages your grades for five classes per semester, and 6 semesters total, and provides you with a more professional looking and comprehensive summary than Python.
